31. Logatorum pedibus.- Phidippus had been iu the service of Dei· 79
otsrus’s deputies, aud perhaps in no mora bonorable a capacity than
that of a footrnan.

34. Qui pro maltis sapa dixisti: In a note to a former oration (page
77, line 4), we have already observed, that Caesar, in the‘early part of
his life, applied himself ιο the business of the bar.

38. De accusatorum spo.- That the student may be able to judge
more impartially of the character of Deiotarus and his accusers, we
will quote an observatiou ofa judicious commentator. “As to the
facts laid down in this oration, we oon say very litue; but, by what
we understand from our author himself in other parts of his writings,
the charges are not so destitute of probability ond proof, as he would
represent them. With regard ιο the characters, the one given of Dei·
cums, throughout this oration, 1 arn apt to believe, is ver much mis·

Ι represented; for, by all other accounts, he appears to ve been a
monster of blood aud cruelty; since he put ιο death sll his own
children, and afterwards Castor’s own father, which may well ac·
count for Castor’s appearing in the prosecution.’'

19. Si....eacusotiono statis usus asset: Itis related that Caesar told 81
Deiotarus, “ You are a ve old man; Pompey is not ιο expect, that

¹ you are to take the field ; erefore 1 beg you will not go in person,
thougb,'if you plesse, you may send your troops; nay, your son at

- their head3 '’ and that Deiotarus was so inveterate an enemy to css-
sar, that hc would not urge even old age as an excuse for not taking
thgdselpffl mmmani lapsare est: Cicero here artfuliy apologizes for
Deiotarus without offending Coesar, by paying the tri ute of flattery,
which in afew lines follows, and by ap ariug to believe the plausi·
ble excuses Caesar had formed to justify 's usurpations.

2. laquem oiim Dii otpas minos, cto.- Euv and emulation cesse 82
with the life of the person envied aud rivolle . An ambitious man,
therefore, will hear without being offended the praises bestowed upon

i adecessed enemy, which, had the enemy been living, would have
induced him to inflict upon the anegyrist the dictates of the sevcrest
vengeanoe. The encomiums icero ere pronounces upon Pompey
were, without doubt, rather pleasing than offensive to Caesam the
more Pompey was extolled, the more merit the conqueror of Pom·

yattributed to himself. Cicero, therefore, who well knew the ef·
ich of compliments, deserves here more credit for his knowledge of

2 mankind, than for the freedom of his praiscs of Pompey.

23. Alexandrinum bollum: After the battle of Pharsalia, Caesar im·

y mediately set ssil forE pt, to which country Pompey had fled after
hisdefeat. Upon his anding,tbe first news he received informed
him of Pom y’s miserable end. He wept, when he heard the ac·

³ count, ands ortiy after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to

of Egyptfktolemy, the acknowledged kin ,ond the celebrated Cle·
opatra, his sister. Caesar ordered both ofg them to maintain their
protensions before him. Photinus, the young king’s guardian, dis·
