ἔμ’ &hnmana tn cletario servius Sulpicius, proconsul in

Greece‚ Cicero, mentionin the petition for Marcellus's return,
writes, ‘⁴ What the senate id was this3 upon the mention of Mar·
eellus by Piso, his brother Caius having thrown himself at Caesar's
feet, they all rose up, and went in a supplicating manner towards
Caesar, 1n short, this day’s work a peared so decent, that I could not
help fancying 1 saw the im o the old republic revivin . When ,
all, there ore, who were aske their opinions efore ine,h returned
thanks to Caesar, excepting Volcatius (for he declared tlrat hc would not
have done it, thou h he had been in the place of Marcellus), l,
as soon ae 1 was calfed upon, changed my mind ; for Ι had resolred
with myself to observe an eternal silence, not through 'any lariness,
but the loss of my former dignity; but Caesar’s greatness of mind
and the laudable zea] of the senate overcame my resolution. Ι gave
thanhs, therefore, to Cesar in a long s ech, and have deprived
myself by it, Ifear, on other occasions, o that honest quiet, which
was my only comfort in these unhssppy times; but since l have
hitherto avoided glring offence (and, ' had always continued silent,
he would have inter' reted it perhaps as a proof of my believing the
republic to be ruinas), 1 shall speak for the future not osten, or rather
very seldom; so as to manage at the same time both his favor and
my own leisure for study.”

21. In qud era filicum: Marcellus and Cicero were of the Pom·
peian party3 aiter the battle ot' Pharsalia, Cicero accepted pardon of
the conqueror; the high spirit of Marcellus and the ancient glory of
his house would not permit him to receive any favars from a master.
He retired to Mitylene.
