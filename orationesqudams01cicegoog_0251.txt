2. Salutarem...iiirrnm‚ eto.- This allodes to the manner of giving
jndgment among the Romans. The judges had each a tablet cover-
ed with war, upon which they wrote the letter A, if they meant ιο
scqoit3 C, il they condemned; and Ν. L. that is, Non liquot, is the
cause appeared doubtful. These tables were delivered to the proper
officer,'who put them into an um, and, aller sorting them, declared
midila orrpymm: Marcus Livius Drusus, who, by Velleius Pater·
culus the historiari, is styled a man most brave, most eloquent and
powerful, and who, accordin to Plutarch, was a leading man in the
senate, when ho saw the wfiole senate oaning under the popular
lawe of Tiberius Gracchus, conceived a esi n of restoring rt ιο its
former dignity‚ and recovering its wonted au ority, which was now
lodged in the equestrian order. The better to carry on his desi ,
he pretended to be in the interest of the people, an promised to ξε·
stow the liberty os the city upon all the Latins ; which, when he

East, aud kepta prisoner at Rome, in the custody of Flavius the
protom and, instead of delivering him up, when Pompey demanded

im, undertook, for a large sum ol' money, to give him his liberty,
and send him home. This occasioned a sharp engagement between
him and Flavius, who marched out os Rome, with a body of mea
well armed, to recover the son of Ti ranes by force. Clodius, how-
