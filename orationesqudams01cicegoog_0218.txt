M. MARCELLUS. 215

2⁴. AEmulo atque imitatore: Marcellus was famous for his forensis 62
f talents, and, of all the orators of his time, seems to have approaehed

nearest to Cicero in the character of a complete speaker.

3l. Offensionibus: While Marcellus was consul, he endeapored tp

cal ed Cesar Rodien· and, during the civil war, fought against Cre·
; sar. These, says Guthrie, with some others of smaller consequence,
were the offences of Marcellus.

33. Suspicionilns: Caesar had entertained suspicions, that Marcel·
lus intended to murder him.

1. Fructum....oite...hodierno die: It should be remembered, that, 63
before Cicero had risen to address Caesar, the whole-senate had paid
the tribute due to the merit of Marcellus, by rising, and warmly
urgin the request made for his return.

3. ulilitate: The family of the Marcelli was of plebeian original,
but, by the hereditary merit of its individuale, had become noble.
Those whose ancestors or themselves had borne any Curnle magis·
tracy, that is, the consulship, the praetorship, the censorship, or the
office of Curule AEdile, was called nobilem· aud of tlre family of the
Marcelli six had been consuls, of whom one was honored with the
consulship five times, and another three.

14. Pace: “ Pardon,” or “ permission.'’

20. Numero pretiorum: Plin informs us, that Caesar had fought
fifty pitched battles, and had slirin 1,192,000 meu. lf the civil wars
are added to the account, says a commentator, this ambitious monster
(Caesar) must have made greater desolation in the world, than any
tyrant, perhaps, that ever lived-Varietate regionum: Caesar had
carried on war in Spain, Britain, Gaul, Egypt, Germanp, Asis,
Africa and Greeoe. He conquered Pornpey at Pharsalia; tolemy
in Egypt; Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, in Pontus, Scipio and
Jubs in Africa; and in Spain the sons of Pernen-celeritate oon-
ficicndi: Such was the rapidity with which Coesur made some of bis
conquesto, that, in describing one of them, he said, Veni, eidi, eici:
“ Ι came, Ι saw, 1 conquered.”

34. Hujus glorie: The glory of pardouing a man whom he sup·
posed an enemy to him.

37. Centurio....proeseetns, etc: The Roman army was formed into
legions; each legion was divided into ten cohorte, each cohort into
three maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. There were
also 300 cavalry usually joined to each legion. These were divided
into ten turnare, or troops, aud each turrim into three decuria, or bodies
of ten men. The centuriones were the officere who commanded the
centuries; the prefecti were appointed to command the allies, and
seem to have had powers similar to those of the legionnry tribunes,
the number of whom was six in each legion,each of whom had under
his command a thousand men.

E⁴13.tiGentes....lrarburcs.· Gauls, Britons, Germane, Africana, and
ans.

hilp Innumerabiles: It is said that Caesar conquered 400 different
nations in Gau13but these natione probably were but petty tribes,
like those of the sausoes of this country.
