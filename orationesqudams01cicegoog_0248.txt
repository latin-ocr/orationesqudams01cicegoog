tthly, From his hopes ot' impunity.

And the evidence, upon which these circumstances ars alleged,
are the words and actions os the deceased.

The conclusion of the whole is, Milo acted on sels-delence, and
Clodius was lawsully killed.

Milo was not tried by the pretor, ss wns usual in criminal cases,

but by aspecial commission and an extraordinary judge. By noea
forma he refers to the strong guard, which Pompey brought to the
trial, in order lo prevent any violence.

12. Cre. Pompeii, sapiemusimi et justissimi oiri: Though Pom y
was not dissatistied wrth Clodius's death, or the manner of it, ut

leased, rather, that the republio was freed at any rate from so pesti-
fient a demagogue, et he resolved to take the benedt of the occasion
sor getting rrd of ilo too, from whose ambition end high spirit he
had reason to apprehend no less trouble. Cicero, bein sensible of
this, as well as the great authority and influence os Compey, en·
deavors, through the whole of tlns oration, to remove the effecta
which they might have upon the minds of the judges.

21. Reliqua, eta.- Atthis trial there were present three ranke of
men; the soldiers, whom Pompey had placed there 3 the citizens, who
waited the event ol* tlre trial; and the Clodians, who exerted them·
selves to proeure the condemnation of Milo. The last mentioned eon·
sisted of profligate, low, and abandoned wretches, whom Clodius, by
his rapines, ba gained over to his interest.

29. Hestemd....concione: 'l'he day before Cicero pleaded for Milo,
the tribune Munatius Plancus called the ople together, and ex·
borted themto appear the nest day in asuile body, when judgmeut
was to be iven, and to deelare their sentimenta in so public a man·
ner, that tfie accused might not be suffered to esoope; which Cicero
refleots u on as an insult upon the liberty of the bench.

l. Quid' enim nodis duodecade: Cicero bere excites the compassion 101
os the judges in his own and Milo's favor, sroma consideration os the
services they hed done the state, and the injurios they had received
srom the Clodiane. Milo might justly claim the hi hest offices, on
account of his merit; and accordin ly had been Crmerly created
tribune, and now stood for the oonsufihip.

12. T. Annii wibanotu, ern.- Milo was a tribune the year aster
Clodius filled that office, and, durin his tribuneship, he ohecked the
seditione os Clodius, and exerted bimself to procare the recall ol'
Cicero t'rorn exile.

14. Insidias Miloni n Clodio fedus.- The great point which
Cicero wishes to prove, is, that Clodius waylaid Mllo; but while he
demonstrates this, he frequently insinuares, that, if Milo had pre·
meditated the death os Clodius, he would have deserved bonore rather
than punishment, lor destroyin so desperate and dangerous 'an ene·
my to the peace and liberty os Come.

30. Negant: The Clodians asserted, that Milo deserved death for
having killed a man. This assertion Cicero refutes by an argument
derived from the examples of former ages of the republic, and srom
decisione to the contrar in parallel cases.

33. Μ. florarii: ln effird year os Rome, when Tullus Hostilius
was king, there was a war between the Romans and the Albaue.
Alter some success on both sides, and when the two armies were noar
each other, thglrllban general discovered, that some ol the neighbor·
