l. Tertium illam Cornelium: Among the Sibyllina verses three 28
K's were found, which, it was supposed, would be fatal toliberty.
They were applied by the Romans to the three Cornelii, Cornelius
Cinna, Cornelius Su la, and Cornelius Lentulus. “

3. Cinnam: During the civil wars between Marius and Sulla, L.
Cornelius Cinna, a man rash in counsel, but resolute in action, was
raised to the consulship, and had no sooner entered upon his office,
than he began to entertain a design of overturning all the acts Sulla
hadpassed. Beingsoon aster deposed, by the senate, from the dig·
nrty of consul, on account of illegal conduct, he ren the city, raised
an arm in Ital , recalled Marius, who had been banished, made
himse master od Rome, murdered the friends of Sulla, who was con·
ducting the warin Asia against Mithridates, aad whom he declared
banished from the city, and, for three successive years, usurped the
consulship, and associated with himself whom he pleased as col-
leagues. At the expiration of these years, Sulla madea ace with
Mithridates, and came toward Rome3 and such were e number
'aad importance of his victorias, the splendor and riches of his army,
and the greatness of his ower, that when Cinna had raised troops
to oppose him, theg revolled from their general, and, when he men-
aced thern, slew im.-Sullam.· The enmity between Marius and
Sulla first arose from a dispute concerning the glory of terminating
the Jugurthine war. The immediate cause of their hostile actions

‘ against each other, was a law passed by P. Sulpicius, transferring
the command of the Asiatic expedition a inst Mithridates from
Sulla to Marius. The law was passed illegal y ; Sulla, who was but
a short distance from Rome, immediately returned, and procured the
banishment of Marius and the death of Sulpicius. He then success·
full conducted the Asiatic war. Iu his absence, the Marian faction
uu er Cinna again took command of the cipy3 Marius was recalled,
Sulla was banished in his turn,and his frien swere murdered. Alter
his peace with Mithridates, however, Sulla returned to the city in

defiance of thle6 grders of the senate, and conquered his enemies.
