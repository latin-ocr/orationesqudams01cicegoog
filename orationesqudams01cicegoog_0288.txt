Having carel'ully examined “The National Speeker,'' lam happy to
state, that it ap ears to me most admirably adopted to the purposes in·
tended. The different parts of the work are well arranged, end the se-
lectione show that they have been ver judiciously made.

The elocutionary analysis is evidently the result of much labor, being
concise, definite, and clear. lr seems to contain all the necessary rulee
for good reading and speaking, illustrated b most appropriate exemplos.
ln short, 1 am much pleased with the whole work.

Mr. Henry B. Muglatlrlia‚-Sir, l arn highl pleased with your
works on elocution. They seem to be 'ust such looks as are required
hy every perpon who is engaged iu teaclring the elements of good reed-
m hhd“sssldcdli{hist'' contains what its title indicates, ‘⁴ the principles
ol'eloeution rendered easy and comprehensive,'’ aud is eminently prac-
tical. Notwithstandiug its brevity, l think it sufficiently full.

“The National speaker '' is well arranged, and the selectione, which
embraoe a suitable variety of style, are judiciously made; the most os

tioned by nature and the most correct usage, and ere expressed in clear
and simplo language. It will sully meet the want 1 have felt ofa
similar work sor my classes in this branch osstudy.
