Mithridates in several battles, and was as capable of finishin the

war, as he was, whom they appointed to be his successor. Wi an

eloquence worthy os a better cause, he [Cicero] most artfully re·

flected on Lucullus, whose reputation as well as authority was to be

made a sacrifice tu the envy of Pompey'3 then he proceeded to des·

cant upon Pompey's character, whrc he set off with all the orna

the African, Spanish and piratic wara, but even of that against the

slaves, the honor oi which was solely due to Crassus. Thus, by

numerous inconsistencies found in him throughout the course of his

philosopher confuted the statesman, the author adds, “as in another
instance the statesman seems to have got the better of the philosopher.
He defends the paradoxes cf the Stoics in a philosophic issertation3
hut, in his oration for Murena, he ridicules those paradoxas in the
