, THE ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW.

INTRODUOTION.

'l'ms celebrated oration, the first which Cicero delivered from tha
Rostra, was pronounced in the dorth year of Rome, in the dlst aar
of the oratore age, and three years before the orations against ati·
line. The Romans at that time were engaged in war with Mithri·
dates, ki of Pontus. This monaroh, able ambitione, warlilre, and
a second annibal in military talenta, as well as in hatred to the Ro-
mans, disdained ιο submit to the commanda os the Roman commis·
sioners in Asia, which checked his enterprises, and, in cool blood,
ordered eight thousand Roman citizens to be massacred in one da .
Sulla, and, rhim, Lucullus, had been sent against this poa-endi
prince; but, though the repeatedly defeated him, they had not en-
m aaairiaeurmmmmu
peace with Mithridates, and give him an opportunity ιο retrieve hia
affairs, and make more vigorous opposition in future. Lucullus prob·
ably would have sulpp‘ugated him, had not a mutiny in the Roman
army existed, and ha ιιοι the general‘s personal enemies in Roma

was dissipated; the Roman neral was removed3 Glabrio, the oon·
sul, who was sent ιο succes Lucullus, was a man of inferior talenta.
At this time, Manilius, one of the tribunes, proposed a law, that
Pompey, who wanthen in Cilicia terminating the piratio war, should
have the govemment of Asia added to his commission, with the com-
mand of the Mithridatio war, and of all the Roman armies in those
parts. This law was much opposed by the senate, who were unwill-
ing to confersoextensive autharit upon any individual, but was so
acceptable ιο the peo le of whom l'ompey was a great favorite, that
none but Catulus aud ldartensius, who had both passed through· tha
consulship, dared to s ali a inst it. lt was defended by Servilius
isanricus and Caesar 3 icero οἷο, at that time praetor, most eloquent·
ly advocated it in this oration.
