ORATION AGAINST Μ. ANTONY.

monumen.

Arrun the amassination of Julius Cesar by Brutus and Cassius,
there were many arties and tumults in Rome. The conspirators,
having nodesign yond the death of the despot, were undecided
respecting the mensures they should taire, and neglected to pursue
those means, which were necessary to reestablish t e liberties of the
republic. Marii Anton ,who, during the last year of Oresar’s life,
was his colleague in e consulship, at first imagined himself in
danger, and began to sortify his house; but, observing the indecis-
ion and pacilio conductos tbe authors of Caesar's death, he' recover-
ed his spirits, and resolved to usurp the governrnent as soon as he
was able, and, on pretence of avenging the murder os his colleague,
todestroy all who should oppose him. To execute this design, he

pretended to baveno other desire, than to see the republic settled ’
upon its old basis. He assumed the appearance of goodness and ἦ
moderation; talked 'os nothing but conciliating measures; aad, as a ]
proos os his sincerrty, moved, that the conspirators should be invited

to take part in the publio deliberatione, and sent his son as a hostage
sor their safety. The invitation was accepted; Brutus supped with
Lepidus, Cassius with Antony5 the day was closed with joy and re·
joicing, and the city thou ht that liberty would be secured with
peace. On pretence os public concord, however, Antony proposed

Antony, being master of Caesar’s papers, and of his secretary Fabe-
rius, by whose hand they were written, sorged and inserted at

pleasure whatever he thought would be of use to him, and publicly Ἴ

sold for money whatever immunities were desired by countries,
cities, rinces, or private men, pretending that they bad been grant·
ed by gnam, and inserted in his books. These, and several other
instances oi' his duplicity and violence, convinced the conspirators,
that no good wasto be expected from him, or a senate which was
under has influence. ·
About this time, Cicero, who had hitherto maintained some de·
of neutrality or moderatiori between the parties, being alarmed
these violences,departed from Rome. He had, before the death of
asar,intei1ded'tn withdraw into Greece, under pretence of super·
intending the education of his son at Athens, and had obtained
Oesar's consent and the leave of the senate for that purpose. On
Gaesar's death, having hopes that the republic was about to revive
he took his resolution to remain in the city3 but, being now satisfied
that these hopes wcre vain, he resumed his former desi of absent·
ing himself; ond instead of applying to the senate or leave, ac-
cepted t'rom Dolabella, the newly-appoinnd governor of Syria, a
communion of lieutenancy, which he was to emplo as a pretence
forcrossing the Ionian sea. Haviug passed through Rbegium, on
