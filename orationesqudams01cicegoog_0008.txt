was originally prepared, and having obtained the reputation 01 an ac·
curate classical school-bools, it was with regret that those who felt a
personal concern in that edition, saw a third and surreptitious one make
its appearance, deformed with tbe grossest errore, and, by the absence 01
011 intelligent care, doing discredit to the classical school with the name
