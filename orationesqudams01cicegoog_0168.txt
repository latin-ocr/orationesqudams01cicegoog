censore. Des rutely eudaemus he was, yet had not more bollness
than levity3 whatever he heard he disclosed; he could not con·
cenl even his own crimes 3 in a word, he considered neither what he
said, nor what he did. There hed been for a long time, a criminul
intercourse between him ond Fulvia, ιι la of quality. He hed ruin-

siderable body of men, wnited only his orders to take the field.
