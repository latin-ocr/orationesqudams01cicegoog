25. SemiliuAlslar ln the aleth year of Rome, there was a famine
in the city, by means of which, Livy says, s private man was near
obtaining possession of sovereign power. Minucius was appointed
hythe senate and people to procure corn in the adjacent countries,
but met with little success. Spurius Melius, the richest private man
in the commonwealth, had bought up ιο much of it in the neigh-
boring provinces, that the agent of the ublic could not purchase
provisions of that kind. The corn, which ilelius had purchased,was '
'berally distributed among the peo le; and so great was the popu·
lsrity he required by this artifice ancl munificence, that a conspiracy
was formed to change the form of govemment; Melius sspired tc
royalty; the peo lewere to take arms in his favor, and the tribunes
consented to se the public liberty. Upon the discovery of the
conspiracy, T. Q. Cincinnatus was appointed dictami, who, sup·
posing that nothing but a stroke of suthorit could destroy so dan·

orae, to crte llelius to appear before his tribunal. Melius, surprised,
endeavored to make his escape3 Servilius commanded a lictor ιο
arrest him. Melius, im loring the assistance of the people, was
resoued by the multitude, and again endeavored ιο escape; but
Servilius, pursui him,overtook hun ran him through the body with >

8 6. C. metus.- Caius Gracchus was a brother of 'liberius Grac·
chus, and like him, was a favorite of the people, and opposed to the
Senate. n the ossorh year of Rome, he was chosen tribune, and,
besides many other acts of popularity, enforced the execution of his
brother's Agrarisn law, and ad ed to rt another clause. Marcus Ful·
vius Plancus was one of the commissionem appointed to divide the
lands. But, two years afterwards, the consul imius called an as·
sembly of the people tc abrogate that law, and, uring the confusion,
which was common in those meetings, Q. Antillius, one of his lictors,
was killed. O imius excited the senators ιο execute immediate
ve anoe on (lmchus and Fulvius Flaccus, who were supposed ιο
be e authors of the lictor’s death, but a violent shower of rain·
obliged the parties to separate. On the next day, Gracchus and
fulvius with their friends were assembled on Mount Aventine; the
senate conferred unlimited power on Opimius; the 'consul imme·
diately attached the partisans of Gracchus, and slew Fulvius, his
sons, and three thousand of his followers. Gracchus sought shelter
in a wood consecrated to the furies, but, perceiving his enemics
approach ιο kill him. ordered a slave to put an end to his life.
