64 says Dr. Middleton, “that he was delivering a speech of thanks, not
only for himself, butiri the name and at the retppest of the senate,

where hissnbject naturally required the ernbellis ments of oratory;
and that all his compliments are gronnded on a supposition, that
Caesar intended to restore the republrc; of which he entertained no
small hopes atthis time, as he srgnihes in a letter to one of Caemr’s
principul friends. This therefore he recommends, enforces, and re·
quires from him in his speech, with the spirit of an old Roman ;
and no reasonable man will think it strange, that so free an address
to a conqueror, in the height of all his power, should want to be
tempered with some few chokes of flattery.” Of this defence every
one will form bis own opinion.

33. Gratdatioat'bas: ln his Cowntentcrs‘es, Cesar informs us, that
twenty-five days os congratulation were dccreed to him for his suc-
cesses in Gaul, and we are told by Dio, that aller his civil wars forty
days more were for like purposes deereedto him. But the day here
spoken of, says Guthrie, was to be preferred to any of these ; because
on itha had extended mercy and forgiveness, which are personal ἵ
virtues, and cannot, lihe the glories of war, be shared by others.

42. Victores bellorum ciciliam.- The victories of Sulla, Marius, Oc-
tavius and Cinna, were succeeded by sanguinar vengeance.

was dosrrous of peace, Cicero advised it, and Pompey rejected it.

peace os slavery, the non-resistance o tame submission to his im-

eral, yet, with manly indignation, he rejected peace, as a republidan
should have done, upon such base conditions. ’

26. Pntdcnaetseiens....cd interitum....volcntcrium: Cicero in this
sentence assigna for the whole reason of his j0ining Pompey what
was only one of his inducements. He really thou bt that cesar

ave been successful, but it rs tobe regretted, that talents so great “
ss those of Cicero confessedly were, should be employed in a service
so dishonorahle as that os flattery and dissimulation.

30. Cum capitis mei periculo: The following comment has been
made upon these words. Cicero was not presentat the battle cl
Pharsalia, nor was Cato, who staid behind also in the camp at
Dyrrachium, which he commanded with lilleen cohorts, when Labi-
enus brought them the news of Pompey’s defeat, upon which Cato
offered the command to Cicero, as the superior in dignity; and, upon
his refusal of it, as Plutarch tells us, young Pompey was so enraged,
that he drew his swerd. and would have killed him upon the spot, if
Cato had not prevented it. Though this fact is not mentioned by
Cicero, yet it is probable he refers to it in this passage.
