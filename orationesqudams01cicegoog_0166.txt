AGAINST CATILINL. 163

ised himself success in his enterprise. These, 10 tbs number of about
100,000, had been settled in the several colonies and districts of Italy,
in tho possession of lands assigned to them b Sulla, which tbe gen·
erality had since wasted by their vices an luxury; so that they
wanted another civil war to repair their shattered fortunes.

About the beginning of June (689), in the consulship of L. Caesar
aad C. Fi ulus, Catiline began to open his project to his confidants;
to each o them at first alone3 and having sounded them sufficiently,
so as to perceive their several tempers and dispositions, he called to-
gether all those who were the most distressed in their affairs, and the
most desperately bold; 'udging it now advisable to speak to them 10
a body. In this assemb y, there were of senatorian rank, P. Cornelius
Lentulus Sura, P. Autronius, L. Cassius Longinus, C. Cethegus, P.
Sulla and S. Sulla (the sons of Servius Sulla), L. Vargunteius, Q.
Annius, M. Porcius Lacca, L. Bestia, aad Q. Curius; of the eques-
trian order, M. Fulvius Nobilior, L. Statilius, P. Gabinius Capito,
and C. Cornelius.

lentulus was descended from a patrician bruach 01 the Cornelian
family, one 01 the most numerous, as wellas the most splendid in
Rome. His grandfather had borne the title of “ Prince of the Senate,’'
and was the most active in the pursuit and destruction 01 C. Grac·
chus, in which he received adangerous wound. The grandson, by the
favor of his noble birth, had been advanced to the consulship about
eight years before, but was turned out 01 the senate soon alter by the
censors, for the notorious infarny of his life, till, by obtaining the praa·
torship a second uine, which he now actually enjoyed, he recovered
his former place and rank in that supreme councrl. His parts were
but moderate, or rather slow; yet the comeliness 01 his person, the
gracefulness and propriety 01 his action, the strength and sweet·
ness 01 his voice, procured him some reputation asa speaker. He
was lazy, luxurious, and profligately wicked3 yet so vain and ambi·
tious,as to expect, 11010 the overthrow of the government, 10 be the '
lirst man 10 the republic ; 111 which sancy he was strongly flattered
by some crasty scothsayers, who assured him, from the Sibyllina
books, that there were three Cornelius's destined to the dominion 01
Rome ς 11011 Cinna and Sulla had alread Ι ssessed it, and the proph·

ocution, and hoping to reap the chief fruit from its success.

Cethegus, 01 an extraction equally noble (being of the Cornelian
family), was 01 a tem r fierce, impetuous, and during, to a degree
even 01 fury. He ha been warmly engaged in the cause 01 Marius,
with whom he was driven out of Rome ; but when Sulla’s affairs
became prosperous, he presently changed sides, and throwing him·
oelf at Sulla's feet, and promising great services, was restored to the
city. After Sulla’s death, by intrigues and fection, he acquired so
great an influence, that, while Pompey was abroad, he governed all
thin s at home; procured 101 Antonius the command over the coast
01 tire Mediterranean, and for Lucullus the mana ment of the
Mithridatio war. Ιο the height 01 this power, he rna ean excursion
into Spain, to raise contributione in that province, where, meeting
with some opposition to his violences, he had the hardiness to insuit,
and even wound the proconsul Q. Metellus Pius. But the insolence of
his conduct, and the infamy 01 his life, graduali diminished, and at
last destroyed, his credit, whea, finding himseif controlled by the
