of the senate, because the murder of Clodius was committed in self· 102
defense, to which every man had a natural right.

t. Ambusti tribuniplebis: The epithet ambusti was applied to Mu· 103
nutius Plancus, because he instigated and assisted the people to burn
the court, and the desks, seats, tables, and books in the Forum-In
tormortuae condones.- These short-lived harangues, by asserting that
the senate was under the control of Cicero, implied, that the senate
decreed nothing against Milo; which contradiction to the assertions
of the other ,enemies of Milo, Cicero here notices.

13. Hunc questionem: “ This extraordinary trial.”

17. lnomto stupro: The word incastus was used hythe Romans in
relation not only to a kinswoman, but also to a vestal virgin, or any
female immediatel employed in performing the rites and ceremo-
nies of religion. it is therefore properly applied to Clodius in rela-
tion to Caesar's wife, while she was engaged in celebrating the mys· ,
turies of Bona Deo.

lu. Potestas esset crepta: When the affair of Clodius's polluting the
ttltssttltttit'gtthltfflll‘ltttttttttttltttttbtl
irnpiety3 upon which the consuls were ordered to provide a law for
bringing Clodius to trial. But Q. Fusius Calenus, one of the tri·
bunes, supported by all the Clodian fection, would not permit the
law to be offered to the suffrages of the citizens. The affair being
likely to produce great disorders, Hortensius proposed an expedient,
which was accepted by both parties, that the tribune Fusius should
puhlish a law for the trial of Clodius by tho praetor, with a select
bench of 'udges The consequence was, that by bribery a majority
of Ehe judges were induced to aequit Clodius, and he thus escaped
wit rm unit .

29. Agyrio :y Viti understood. Cicero hare artfully insinuates, that,
though the senate had found the fray upon the Appian Way to be
an act of treason against the commonwealth‚ yet that Milo could
never be affected by that decree, because, sa she, it was thesio·
lence, that constituted the treason Now lodius, the aggressor,
was the author of the violence, and not Milo,t0 whom the principles
of sels-defence, without an regard to the consequences, gavea
right to preserve his own li e.

352. Qudd si, cta: Had not the senate been controlled b the tri·
hune Munatius Plancus, they would have demeed, that Milo should
be tripid in the usual form, and he probably would have been ac-

uitte .
q 36. Divisa sententio: When any opinion, proposed tn the senate,

was thought too general, and to include several distinct articles,

some of which mig tbe approved, and others rejected, it was usual
to require that it might be divided. This was the case with the
first decree relative to the death of Clodius3 it contained three dis-
tinct charges; it declared that the death of Clodius, the burnin of
the court, and the attaclr upon Lepidus's house, were acts hostie to
the commonwealth. Neither party would agree to this decree en·
tirely; the enemies of Milo therefore obtained a new decree, that
there should be a special trial of the authores Clodius’s death.

36. Postulcnte neseio quo: This was Q. Fusius, a senator, whorn
Munatius Plancus had corrupted by bribery. Cicero does not name
him, because he was in the senate.

lt. Qadd nisi omissa, etc.- Cicero well knew ot' what great au·
thority Pompey’s opinion would be in this trial. He therefore, with·
