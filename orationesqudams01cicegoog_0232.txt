THE ORATION FOR THE POET ARCHIAS.

—

mulionesnon.

Tura elegant oration was delivered in the eeend year of Rome, two
years aster the consulship of Cicero, and one ear aster the defeat of
Catiline and his accomphces. Inearly life icero had been placed
under the tuition of Aulus Lucinius Archias,a native of Antioch,
, and a man patronised by men of the greatest eminence in Rome for
his learning, genius, and politeness. His celebrity was se great,
that Lucullus invited him ιο reside in his family, and gave him the

lar poet and instructor, however, was interrupted by the malignity
of an obscure person, of the name of Gracchus, or by the subornalion
of those who persuaded him ιο acts of enmity against Archias. Syl·
vanus and Carbo had passed alaw, which enacted, that those should
beesteemed Roman crtirens, who were admitted ιο the freedom of

the rator within sixty days. Upon this law, in the consulship of
M. i. Piso and Μ. V. Messala, Gracchus accused Archias ; he said
that Archias lived in the city aa a citizen, while he was not entitled
to the rights of citizenship. He denied that Archias was admitted
ιο the freedom of any of the confederated cities, that he had an abods
in ltaly, at the time the law was passed, and that he hed claimed the
privileges of acitizen before the praetor. In this oration, which was
delivered before the preter, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructor: he refutes the alle tiens of Gracchus, and proves
that Archias was admitted ιο the eedom of Heraclea and other
citios, that he dwelt in ltaly at the time of the passing of the law,
and that he claimed hir rivile s before the pretor. 'l'he orator,
however, does not contine 'macl ιο the defence ofArchias,but, with
great beant and elegance, descants upon the praises cf poetry in
general, an upon the talenta and meritos the de endant. Accordin
ιο Dr. Middleton, Cicero “expected for his peina an immortality oi

things, instead of deriving any addition of gwy irem Archies’s com·

writings.” At the time of delivering this oration, Cicero was in the
