18. Omnia, etc.- Cicero here advises Cesar to restore the repub· 67
lio, and correct the abuses of its constitution; and such was his ad·
dress, that the advice was not displeasing to the despot; but it was
improbable that an usurper so ambitious of power ss was Coesar,
should observe counsels so contrary to the desig'ns for the comple·
tion of which he had fought and slain above amillion of men.

30. Iliam....oooem....sattr diu....ot‘ci.· Atler having complanes of

Insatiable ambition and goodness are seldom companions.

28. Imperia, provinciae, etc: Cesar had commanded an army in
Gaul, Britain, Germany and Africa. Spain, aller lris praitorship,
and Gaul aller his consulshi , were tha provinces assigned to him.
He first built a brid over the Rhine, over which he passed his army,
and conquered the rmans. He first commanded a floetin thsAt-
